# A Simple HTML5 Memory Card Game 

**Play it here:** https://codepen.io/ginocaparas/full/eYxpodG

So I created this fun little game on October 27, 2023. Here's the thing: I suck at Javascript. Like, I can't actually write code from scratch -- I just try to learn as much as I can from existing lines of code that others have written.

Fortunately there's ChatGPT.

I had a very productive back-and-forth with ChatGPT -- first I asked it to create a simple memory game in HTML5. Then, I spruced up the CSS, added cat pics, used Twitter Bootstrap for the HTML framework, and then... there we have it. A fully working memory card game made in HTML5 and Javascript.

PS. My son loves playing it. Can you beat his high score of 10 points?

# Mechanics

1. Pick two cards.
2. If they match, you get 2 points.
3. If they don't match, you lose 1 point.
4. Repeat until all cards have been matched with each other. Highest possible score is 12!

# Iterations

You can see all the iterations here:
- V1: Barebones, no art, no point system. https://codepen.io/ginocaparas/pen/dyaYrrj
- V2: More cards, plus a new point system. https://codepen.io/ginocaparas/pen/RwvWObd
- V3: Latest version. Added new artwork, moved to Twitter Bootstrap framework, revised Game Over screens. https://codepen.io/ginocaparas/pen/eYxpodG
